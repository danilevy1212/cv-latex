% Summary
\addblocktext{Summary}{
  \begin{addmargin}[0cm]{0.66cm}
    \hspace{4ex} Passionate about learning new skills and expanding my knowledge in order to solve information systems problems. I enjoy the challenge of finding concrete solutions to open-ended questions, carefully considering all available options, their advantages and disadvantages and executing the most appropriate. In my spare time I study Japanese, do sports and research technologies beyond the scope of those I typically use in my workplace.
